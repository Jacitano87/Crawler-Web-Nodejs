<p><strong>Karmella Haynes</strong> is an assistant professor at Arizona State University’s School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering. She also serves as the head judge for the iGEM competition. She earned her Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics at Washington University, St. Louis. Postdoctoral fellowships at Davidson College and Harvard Medical School introduced her to synthetic biology. Her work on bacterial computers was featured on NPR’s Science Friday and in 2008 was recognized as “Publication of the Year” by the Journal of Biological Engineering. Today, her research aims to regulate therapeutic genes by engineering human chromosomes. Karmella is motivated to share mammalian cell resources through open-source repositories so that the synthetic biology community can cooperatively accelerate science’s progress towards rationally designed therapeutics.</p>
