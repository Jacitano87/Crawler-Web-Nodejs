<p><strong>Dr. Kim de Mora</strong> started his career in mechanical engineering with a degree from the University of Edinburgh. After a brief stint in industry, Dr. de Mora chose to pursue a PhD in synthetic biology, starting with participation in iGEM. Being awarded a Lessells scholarship from the Royal Society of Edinburgh allowed de Mora to spend time at Harvard Medical School in one of the first labs to work on yeast synbio. His time in Boston was also spent interacting and volunteering with iGEM. Seven years, a brief stint as a postdoc, several transatlantic moves and more than a dozen iGEM Jamborees later, de Mora now runs the judging and new tracks programs at the iGEM Foundation.</p>

<div class="noakes-accordion-item-content">
<p>An inventor of technologies that harness evolution, <strong>Kevin EsveltÂ </strong>studies ways of using molecular tools to alter populations and ecosystems. He received his PhD from Harvard University in 2010 for inventing Phage-Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE), a synthetic microbial ecosystem for rapidly evolving molecular tools. As a Fellow of the Wyss Institute, he helped pioneer the development of a powerful new method of genome engineering based on CRISPR/Cas9, an enzyme that can cut DNA at almost any desired sequence. Â Kevin recently outlined how Cas9 might be used to alter wild populations of sexually reproducing organisms by building evolutionarily stable &#8220;gene drives&#8221;. Recognizing the potential implications of a general way to alter the traits of entire populations, Kevin and colleagues detailed ways to control, block, or even reverse changes made by gene drives and emphasized the importance of careful evaluation and regulatory reform. Because we jointly share and rely on a healthy environment, he is deeply concerned with ensuring that gene drives and other inherently collective technologies are only used after transparent, broadly inclusive, and well-informed discussions.</p>

She founded Revolution Bioengineering with colleague Nikolai Braun to develop unexpectedly beautiful biotechnology, starting with flowers that change color throughout the day. RevBio now works with artists, bioethicists, engineers, and scientists to introduce the potential and possibility of synthetic biology through these flowers. After receiving her Bachelorâs in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 2004, Havens accepted a commission in the United States Air Force. She left active duty to pursue a degree in a synthetic biology laboratory and received her M.S. from Colorado State University in 2014.</p>
