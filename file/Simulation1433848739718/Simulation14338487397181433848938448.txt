				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://isbmolecularme.com/wp-content/uploads/CP_mm_web.jpg" class="attachment-featured-small wp-post-image" alt="Chris Plaisier" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;" /><p>From our inception, we at ISB have been committed to knowledge transfer. This profound sense of responsibility to share what we learn serves as the foundation for our signature professional course on systems biology. This year’s course, which takes place July 27-31 in ISB’s conference facility, will offer a few new features, including lightning talks about systems biology technologies and a mini symposium consisting of research vignettes from nine ISB researchers. The course is geared toward graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and principal investigators. If you or someone you know would be interested in participating, visit course.systemsbiology.net for registration info. (This event is co-sponsored by ISB&#8217;s Center for Systems Biology.)</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Plaisier, a senior research scientist in the Baliga Lab and one of the organizers of the summer course, shares some thoughts:</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why is it important for ISB to offer a systems biology course?</strong><br />
<strong>CP:</strong> ISB does lots of amazing science and we do try to break the insights down for the public who pays for our research to see. But that isn’t enough. What we really need is a way to get the new systems biology ideas and methods we and others have developed into the hands of our colleagues. Science is a group effort and by teaching others to use our systems approaches we will greatly enhance their ability to conduct research and solve complex biological problems.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What distinguishes the systems biology course at ISB from any other?</strong><br />
<strong>CP:</strong> Last year we revamped and updated our course to be focused on Systems Biology of Disease because there were no courses like it out there. The goal of this course is to give researchers the tools needed to divide patients into meaningful groups, discover molecular markers that distinguish these groups, and how to use networks to discover drug targets. Together these tools allow researchers to do personalized medicine where treatments are tailored to a specific patient’s disease.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do students gain from experiencing ISB’s course?</strong><br />
<strong>CP:</strong> Participants in the ISB summer course will gain experience using systems biology approaches that allow them to carry out personalized medicine. They will also experience presentations of excellent examples of systems biology from world experts and the exceptional researchers at ISB.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does learning systems biology help researchers?</strong><br />
<strong>CP:</strong> It is vitally important to think more holistically in this age of big data and with an understanding that interactions can be just as important as single effects. The traditional approach of focusing on single isolated components just won’t work in the complex systems that are human beings. We advocate instead to embrace the complexity and have developed approaches that allow us to uncover the underlying causes of human diseases no matter how complex.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why should non-scientists care about systems biology?</strong><br />
<strong>CP:</strong> Systems biology is the future of research and will provide the tools needed to understand complex diseases like cancer, heart disease, obesity, etc., that are plaguing our society. With systems biology, we will learn how all of the different aspects of human health (diet, genetics and environment) affect these diseases and how to treat each individual patient with personalized medicine.</p>

The genes in DNA are translated into proteins, strings of amino acids that fold into three-dimensional structures. The type and order of the amino acids in a protein will change its shape and determine its special function. Proteins are the molecules that make life happen: they are the powerplants that turn food into energy, the machines that make cells move, and even the computers that read DNA and make more proteins. The information to build every protein in an organism is contained in the DNA, but not every protein is produced at once or in the same amount. Think of a cell in your liver and a cell in your retina &#8211; both cells contain identical DNA, but very different subsets of proteins are being produced in order to give each cell its special function. Proteomics is the discipline of identifying and quantifying the proteins present in an organism. At ISB, we use state-of-the-art scientific instruments and cutting edge computational techniques to detect thousands of proteins at once, giving us a systems-level view of the molecular machinery of life.</p>

More than 120 people attended the event, which took place as part of the South Lake Union Art Walk.<br />
<a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/wp-content/uploads/BF-Seattle.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3731" src="http://isbmolecularme.com/wp-content/uploads/BF-Seattle-300x254.jpg" alt="BF Seattle" /></a><br />
BIO·FICTION explores the emerging field of synthetic biology from different disciplinary angles including science and engineering, social science, cultural studies, amateur biology, filmmaking, art and design. The original program had presentations, panel discussions, do-it-yourself biology demos, performances, art works and, of course, film screenings. It featured short films on any aspect of synthetic biology, including documentary films, animation and science fiction. BIO·FICTION was created by Markus Schmidt and Camillo Meinhart and was held in Vienna in 2011 and again in 2014. The original BIO·FICTION film jury consisted of: Erich Berger (FI), Sebastian Harrer (DE), Jens Hauser (DK), Philippe Marlière (FR), Vitor Martins dos Santos (NL), Robert Styblo (AU), Huib de Vriend (NL) and Katherina T. Zakravsky (AU).</p>
<p>Currently, the BIO·FICTION program is being shared all over the world, and Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) in Seattle is the first organization to present the event in the United States.</p>
<p>The film selection was curated by Allison Kudla and a committee that included Aron Thompson, Sui Huang, Nick Newcombe and Nitin Baliga. More than 8 hours of films, we considered three vectors as we made our selection criteria for the films focused on synthetic biology: Is it scientifically plausible and well-researched? Does it have practical use or benefit? Does it raise interesting questions?</p>
<div id="attachment_3737" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/wp-content/uploads/PD5A5175.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3737 size-large" src="http://isbmolecularme.com/wp-content/uploads/PD5A5175-800x533.jpg" alt="Actor Tom Skerritt was one of the featured panelists at BIO-FICTION film fest at Institute for Systems Biology.

May 7, 2015</p></div>
<p>We also included films that were visually stunning, provocative art projects, and/or scientific visualizations of processes happening at scales beyond our operating awareness. We end the film program with the documentary “Simply Complex,” a well-made and entirely factual overview of the general state of research in genetics and health.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Lee Hood</strong>, President of ISB, moderated the panel and opened the screening with some interesting remarks on the importance of consilience across art, science and the humanities.</p>
<p>The panel consisted of <strong>Tom Skerritt</strong>, acclaimed American Actor and Co-founder of <a href="http://thefilmschool.com/">the Film School;</a> <strong>Dr. Phillip Thurtle</strong>, Associate Professor in CHID and History at the University of Washington; <strong>Dr. Nitin Baliga</strong>, Professor, SVP &amp; Director of ISB; and <strong>Dr. Allison Kudla</strong>, Interdisciplinary Artist and Designer in the Communications Department at ISB.</p>
<p>The panel discussed some of the interesting questions raised by the films and reflected on the complexities associated with biology at the intersections of engineering, technology and computation.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">More Art Events at ISB: <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/symposium-on-taoism-biology-life/" target="_blank">Taoism, Biology &amp; Art</a> (May 18)</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>As the name of the program states, the films are fiction, and while the science is largely speculative, the films help to encourage entry points for discussion on the topic of the future of biology and the role that art can play in communicating speculative futures. At ISB, we do not explicitly practice synthetic biology as it is commonly understood and reflected in the films. Nonetheless, we are pioneers of a novel interdisciplinary approach to life sciences that unites biology with engineering, computer science and technology to benefit mankind and our planet in novel ways. Therefore, ISB’s multi-faceted culture of creativity promotes discussion and provokes thought on complex topics of our life, in some ways not unlike what these films seek to achieve through the arts.</p>

But for ISB, today is GiveBIG, Seattle Foundation&#8217;s day of community giving. When you give to ISB today, Seattle Foundation will match a percentage of your gift. You can go directly to ISB&#8217;s page and follow the links. Remember, to give BEFORE MIDNIGHT today, May 5.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.seattlefoundation.org/npos/Pages/InstituteforSystemsBiology.aspx?bv=nposearch" target="_blank">Give Now</a></h3>
<p>But in case you need a little more background, here are 7 reasons to give to ISB.</p>
<p><strong>1. We are the &#8220;mother ship&#8221;</strong> when it comes to systems biology. We were founded by Dr. Lee Hood who has been the most vocal, high-profile, globetrotting ambassador for the practice of systems biology. Need a little systems biology 101? You can read about these concepts: <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/systems-biology-101-what-is-isbs-innovation-engine/" target="_blank">ISB&#8217;s Innovation Engine</a>, <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/systems-biology-101-network-of-networks/" target="_blank">Network of Networks</a>, and <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/systems-biology-101-on-being-interdisciplinary/" target="_blank">On Being Interdisciplinary</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. We develop new technologies</strong> all the time that help researchers around the world do their jobs better and more efficiently. Read about the world&#8217;s <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/the-most-powerful-tool-for-reconstructing-a-gene-network/" target="_blank">most powerful tool for reconstructing gene networks</a>, or how we&#8217;re creating <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/tag/tuberculosis/" target="_blank">better road maps for researching tuberculosis</a>, or how we&#8217;re trying to develop better cancer diagnostic tools such as this method for <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/isb-innovations-ultrasound-based-tumor-biopsies/" target="_blank">ultrasound biopsies</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9d1Pw5ditfg?rel=0" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>3. We equalize K-12 science education.</strong> It is unusual for a research organization to have an education program as well-developed and effective as ISB. Our Logan Center for Education and Systems Education Experiences teams have made a tremendous impact in bringing high quality professional development for science educators at the K-12 and community college levels. Read about some of our recent <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/category/isb-news/education/" target="_blank">education wins</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. The women of ISB rock.</strong> Period. Read about our <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/isbs-women-in-oceanography/" target="_blank">leading oceanographers</a> or watch this interview with one of our software engineers.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HrpcOcjNvRY?rel=0" width="100%" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>5. We don&#8217;t shy away from BHAGs</strong> – big hairy audacious goals – like the <a href="http://100k.systemsbiology.net/" target="_blank">100K Wellness Project</a> or the <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/isb-launches-3-year-wilke-lyme-disease-project-with-2-13m-funding-2/" target="_blank">Wilke Lyme Disease Project</a> or <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/tag/cancer-research/" target="_blank">tackling dozens of cancers</a> or <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/a-breakthrough-in-understanding-the-genetic-architecture-of-bipolar-disorder/" target="_blank">understanding bipolar disease</a>.</p>
<p><strong>6. We are leaders in proteomics</strong> – the study of how proteins function in, well, everything, such as: <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/researchers-find-key-protein-tied-to-production-of-good-cholesterol/" target="_blank">good cholesterol</a>, <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/isb-and-pg-researchers-identify-markers-of-healthy-skin-development/" target="_blank">healthy skin</a>, <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/new-structural-map-helps-to-understand-aggressive-tumors/" target="_blank">aggressive tumors</a>, and the <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/isb-researchers-identify-new-protein-modification-critical-to-growth-of-tb-pathogen/" target="_blank">tuberculosis pathogen</a>.</p>
<p><strong>7. The &#8216;Minds of ISB&#8217; are singular.</strong> Need some inspiration, peruse these quotes from researchers who are featured in our <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/isb-minds/" target="_blank">Minds of ISB project</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</strong></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><b>Marysville School District Scores $500,000 OSPI Funding for </b><b>Science &amp; Engineering Workshops for Teachers<br />
</b></h4>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><i>3-Year Award Supports Partnership with ISB &amp; UW Engineering to Provide Professional Development for District</i></h5>
<p>SEATTLE, May 1, 2015 – The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) has announced that the Marysville School District will receive a three-year $500,000 Math &amp; Science Partnership (MSP) Grant to support continued work with ISB’s Logan Center for Education and UW Engineering. Marysville is one of seven area agencies that is receiving an MSP award.</p>
<p>The funds will allow Marysville’s middle school science teachers and several high school and fifth grade science teachers to participate in workshops and community-based externships to learn about engineering and how engineering connects to the lives of their students.</p>
<p>“We are extremely excited about this project,” said Dana Riley Black, Director for ISB’s Logan Center for Education. “These experiences offer teachers a unique introduction to the Next Generation Science Standards providing opportunity for all students not only to learn science, but also engineering. This partnership will provide lessons learned about engineering education that can be shared broadly.”</p>
<p>The Logan Center, which has been a longtime advocate for high-quality science education for all students, has partnered with the Marysville district for several years, but consistent funding has been a challenge. The OSPI award makes it possible for teachers to learn about science and engineering education through workshops, in the field, and to use their classrooms as laboratories to study how they can translate their knowledge into daily practice.</p>
<p>“The most important result of the project will be that hundreds of Marysville students will benefit from teachers who provide authentic engineering experiences in their science instruction,” said Kyle Kinoshita, Executive Director of Learning and Teaching for the Marysville School District. “This partnership will greatly strengthen college- and career-readiness efforts in our school district.”</p>

<h6><b>About Institute for Systems Biology:</b></h6>
<h6>The Institute for Systems Biology is a nonprofit biomedical research organization based in Seattle, Washington. It was founded in 2000 by systems biologist Leroy Hood, immunologist Alan Aderem, and protein chemist Ruedi Aebersold. ISB was established on the belief that the conventional models for exploring and funding breakthrough science have not caught up with the real potential of what is possible today. ISB serves as the ultimate environment where scientific collaboration stretches across disciplines, where our researchers have the intellectual freedom to challenge the status quo, and where grand visions for breakthroughs in human health inspire a collective drive to achieve the seemingly impossible. Our core values ensure that we always keep our focus on the big ideas that eventually will have the biggest impact on human health.</h6>

One of our labs, for example, includes molecular biologists, microbiologists, geneticists, engineers, oceanographers, and even an astrophysicist. The complexity of biology in this age of “big data” requires diverse teams in order tackle such vast amounts of data and to make sense of it all. New technologies that crunch data faster and more efficiently also permit researchers to re-analyze existing datasets, a process which often reveals undiscovered information. Complementary skills empower any of our groups of researchers to better understand biological or environmental challenges from different perspectives and to arrive at shareable insights more quickly. Our interdisciplinary teams have contributed notable advances to everything from ocean acidification to neurodegenerative diseases and tuberculosis to multiple cancers.</p>

<p>Institute for Systems Biology presents:</p>
<h3>Taoism, Biology and Life</h3>
<p>Please join ISB in welcoming <strong>Xiao Dong Feng</strong> and <strong>Dr. Stephen Littl</strong>e for a symposium on Taoism, Biology and Life. Opening remarks by Dr. Lee Hood. <em>This event is free and open to the public.</em></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Location:</strong> ISB Main Floor, 401 Terry Ave N, Seattle<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> Monday, May 18<br />
<strong>Time:</strong> 3:15pm &#8211; 5pm</p></blockquote>
<h4>Biographies:</h4>
<p><strong>Xiao Dong Feng</strong> was born in 1963 in the Anhui Province, where he learned how to paint early in his childhood. He considers painting a rich expression of life and often draws from his experience as an artist and a musician, and from having spent his formative years in the countryside as a peasant and, later on, a soldier and member of the government propaganda team. Critics describe Feng&#8217;s work as having the concise lyricism of Chinese poetry: a few simple strokes brings a scene to life.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stephen Little</strong> initially studied nuclear physics, but changed his major to Chinese art. He received a B.A. from Cornell University in 1975, an M.A. from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1977, and a Ph.D. from Yale University in 1987. He held curatorial positions at the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco (1977–1982), the Cleveland Museum of Art (1987–1989), and the Honolulu Museum of Art (1989–1994). He held the Pritzker Curatorship of Asian Art at the Art Institute of Chicago (1995–2002), prior to becoming Director of the Honolulu Museum of Art in 2003. In 2011, Little became department head and curator of Chinese and Korean art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). In his recent work he has aimed at achieving images that are spatially ambiguous, reflecting his study of nuclear physics and Daoism, the ancient Chinese system of belief that perceives reality as fluid, and teaches a way of living in balance with the natural world.</p>

Director for Logan Center for Education</p>
<p>Recognizing that systems biology has fostered a paradigm shift in the practice of biology, ISB has interest in supporting educators in advancing science-related course offerings to better reflect contemporary practices of biology. With leadership from ISB’s <a href="http://logancenter.systemsbiology.net/" target="_blank">Logan Center for Education</a>, ISB educators and scientists have collaborated with Washington’s State Board for Community and Technical Colleges to offer faculty development for instructors of undergraduate biology. To-date, the partnership has hosted four workshops (and will host another in May) for upwards of 100 faculty members representing nearly all of the state’s 34 community and technical colleges.</p>
<p>Lucas Myers is a Biology Instructor at Lower Columbia College located in Longview, Washington. Lucas has been a participant in three faculty development experiences, and as a result, has made changes to his General Biology course.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Describe the Biology 160 student population.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The student population has mainly consisted of allied health students as it is a prerequisite to the Human Anatomy/Physiology course. In the last year or so, we have gained enrollment in this course due to an increase in non-science majors or allied health students taking this course as their natural science with a lab requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What made you attend the November faculty development workshop?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> After attending the first workshop in May 2014, I was very intrigued and excited about the partnership with ISB. But I was not quite sure how this fit into my current courses and teaching practices. I chose to come again in November, because I enjoy an opportunity to learn from others in the field of science whether it be research or education. I was excited to try and develop a lesson that could be put into my biology course and see actual data sets that are accessible and user-friendly.</p>
<div id="attachment_3672" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/wp-content/uploads/PD5A3117.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3672 size-medium" src="http://isbmolecularme.com/wp-content/uploads/PD5A3117-300x200.jpg" alt="PD5A3117" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lucas Myers, left, with ISB research scientist Brady Bernard, right.</p></div>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What about the workshops caused you to want to shift your teaching of Biology 160? </strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I was excited about the possibilities of using the cancer and genomic data sets presented by <strong>ISB Research Scientist Brady Bernard</strong>. I was not sure I really understood cancer enough to use the data sets yet, but understood cancer enough to know that it would be a great starting point to redesign my cell biology course to teach the cell components and functions through the lens of cancer. I embarked on the experience of learning more about the biology of cancer and during the winter quarter of 2015 I taught my Biology 160 course through the lens of cancer. I saw the future of education within the message that ISB was delivering. I wanted to create students who investigated and applied material, rather than just memorized it. I want them to know how to find, understand and articulate the information rather than succeed in standardized exams. There is more growth, learning and confidence building that occurs in students when they are given the opportunity to learn through an inquiry and applied approach.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What changes did you make to Biology 160?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> In addition to utilizing the lens of cancer, I threw out the linear approach to teaching concepts and created concept maps for three different exams that we would be taking. Many times the material overlapped, but each time we were looking at it from a different angle or perspective and learning more about that specific concept. I also grouped students into teams that researched a specific cancer type and created a web page during the quarter that contained information on the cancer as it directly pertained to the material covered in the course.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What impact did these changes have on your students’ learning?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Students took three take-home exams that were applied and research-based. They were to complete five of 10 essay questions over the course of five hours. In addition, students took a pre-test and a cumulative assessment. The average pre-test score was near 50 percent and the average on the cumulative was near 70 percent. Normally, students do not perform that well on cumulative exams.</p>
<div id="attachment_3677" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/wp-content/uploads/PD5A3089.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3677 size-medium" src="http://isbmolecularme.com/wp-content/uploads/PD5A3089-300x200.jpg" alt="PD5A3089" width="300" height="200" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">ISB bioinformatics scientist Varsha Dhankani, right, works with a faculty member attending one of the Logan Center&#8217;s workshops for undergraduate biology instructors.</p></div>
<p>This is one of those incidents where data did show the impact, but there was a much larger impact that is more difficult to show in data. There are many students who struggle on traditional exams and in traditional courses and therefore end up dropping the course. I had numerous students this past quarter that may have had low exam scores on the research and essay exams early in the quarter but slowly improved. When they took the cumulative, they did very well.</p>
<p>These type of results showed that teaching the biology material through the cancer lens and providing an avenue for the inquiry-based learning allowed the students to develop a better understanding of the material. Their biology skills, by the end of the quarter, met the course competencies. I was also amazed by the ability of students to understand graduate-level biology material in a 100-level course as well as the thirst to understand material that wasn’t even necessary for the course. Students can outperform our expectations if we give them the avenue, confidence and be there to assist in their journey. I will continue to avoid handcuffing my students and allowing them to prepare themselves for a career outside of the classroom.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>What do you conceive as next steps for your Biology 160 course?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I will be continuing to teach the course in the same manner. After the most recent workshop in March and having the opportunity to look at cancer data sets with Brady Bernard, I feel comfortable in using the data sets in the classroom. I will be developing lesson plans for both online and in-classroom work around specific data sets, having students learn about a specific protein or gene and then researching data connected to that gene or protein in order to have the students make connections or draw conclusions from their research.</p>

<p>Through the MJ Murdock Charitable Trust’s <a href="https://www.murdock-trust.org/grants/partners-science.php" target="_blank">Partners in Science</a> program, ISB has been able to host two high school science teachers in the <a href="http://www.systemsbiology.org/baliga-group" target="_blank">Baliga Lab</a> to participate in active research projects. The experience offers teachers valuable insight that textbooks can’t offer. Teachers Tami Caraballo (Glacier Peak High School) and Jennifer Duncan-Taylor (Port Angeles High School) share their thoughts about their work at ISB.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://systemsbiology.org/support" class="su-button su-button-style-default" style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#ff9933;border-color:#cc7a29;border-radius:5px;-moz-border-radius:5px;-webkit-border-radius:5px" target="_self"><span style="color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 16px;font-size:13px;line-height:26px;border-color:#ffb870;border-radius:5px;-moz-border-radius:5px;-webkit-border-radius:5px;text-shadow:none;-moz-text-shadow:none;-webkit-text-shadow:none"> How to help</span></a></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What’s the best part about the mentorship?</b></p>
<p><b>JDT:</b> I worked on something REAL. Even though I often felt in over my head and a little panicked that I wasn’t keeping up, I was always aware that the work being done was important—even if my part was tiny. I appreciated the “big picture” and how science can work to solve the most important problems plaguing our planet. This has also been an unparalleled opportunity for me to establish long-term relationships with mentor scientists that will continue to enrich my approach to teaching science to teenagers.</p>
<p><b>TC:</b> The best part of the mentorship were the conversations with ISB staff and interns!</p>
<p><b>What’s the benefit to working with scientists in a lab?</b></p>
<p><b>TC:</b> The most intriguing part of working with scientific researchers was gaining an understanding of what that particular field of work actually involves. In school, we are totally time-task-driven. In other words, everything is governed by the bell schedule. There is no time to actually sit, read, let alone think. One thing that I was reminded of over the past two summers is that what is often viewed as “down time” may be the most productive time. Just being given the time to reflect and discuss with others after what we heard in a lecture was invaluable.</p>
<p><b>JDT:</b> Learning by immersion! The continuous work of following a project through various stages: participating in the planning, the bench work, the computations and analysis of the data has been a rich and deeply gratifying experience. These two summers have taught me new protocols, honed my laboratory techniques and elevated my hands-on skills that I can pass on to my students.</p>

<p><b>How has working with ISB influenced your teaching?</b></p>
<p><b>TC: </b>My work at ISB gave me new insight and information that I am able to take directly back to my students. It also gave me a stronger science foundation from which to work. The speed at which new developments are occurring in the life sciences makes it a challenge for teachers outside of the research arena to stay somewhat current.</p>
<p><b>JDT:</b> I have found that it has refreshed my classroom perspective and has brought me “full circle.” Having focused on environmental issues at the beginning of my teaching career, then becoming enchanted with DNA and all the cool biotech activities that became available to high school classrooms, this OA research and my participation at ISB has brought me back to my environmental roots while deeply incorporating the use of molecular and biotechnology.</p>
<p><b>What difference have you noticed in your students? Are they more interested in science?</b></p>
<p><b>JDT:</b> When they see their teacher jazzed up about something, they get fired up too. High school students crave authentic, meaningful experiences. “Cookbook” science is convenient for the teacher and teaches skills to the younger learners, but high school students are savvy and want to do work that is genuine. Getting students excited about real world projects with real world issues is the best teaching practice and the best for turning kids into scientists and engaged citizens.</p>
<p><b>TC:</b> If I am able to share the realities of my experience and model what it is like to be a learner, that makes it reachable and real to my students.</p>
<p><b>What excites you about the next phase of your Partners in Science supplemental award? </b></p>
<p><b>JDT:</b> The Partners in Science program just funded my follow-up project. My sophomore biology students will be able to grow diatoms in different nutrient-rich environments and monitor their population growth. My junior/senior biotech students will remove samples of cells from those cultures and assay the activity of the GAPDH gene. I’m counting on ISB scientists to continue their support as advisors to me and my students.<br />
<b>TC:</b> My follow-up project idea – which I am working on with <a href="http://www.systemsbiology.org/jacob-valenzuela" target="_blank">Jake Valenzuela</a>, who’s a postdoc in the Baliga Lab at ISB – will challenge my students to feed and/or fuel the world with algae. This project is totally student-driven with some great scientific expertise on the side to guide us.</p>

<p>By Arjun Raman</p>
<p>For most of the history of biology, data was a limiting quantity that was painstakingly gathered and meticulously curated. However, the meteoric rise of sequencing technology accompanied by the parallel emergence of computing has fueled a recent data explosion in biology. Such novel technologies allow scientists to ask new questions and revisit old ones with a fresh perspective. However, it also brings new problems when interpreting the deluge of information.</p>
<p>Nearly a decade ago, members of the Baliga group at the Institute for Systems Biology published a landmark paper describing cMonkey, an innovative method to accurately map gene networks within any organism from microbes to humans. The method takes advantage of expanding biological datasets and computational power, and has since been applied to many different organisms across a huge range of publicly and privately generated experimental data.</p>
<p>Prior to cMonkey, it was common practice to group sets of genes that had similar expression levels across the experimental conditions using a process termed clustering. However, this practice inherently assumes that gene clusters are static. While this assumption may apply in limited circumstances, such as a binary treatment vs. control experimental setup, it may not be true across a wide variety of conditions. Thus, ISB researchers set out to create a novel method to cluster both genes and conditions simultaneously, known as biclustering. Unlike clustering, biclustering is a difficult and arguably impossible computational problem, meaning that no solution is guaranteed to be optimal.

<p>In an update, published on April 15 in the journal <em>Nucleic Acids Research</em>, ISB researchers present the evolution of cMonkey. The paper describes updates to the algorithm – cMonkey2 – and assessed performance against alternative platforms using three distinct datasets from two different bacterial organisms and human cancer cells. Detailed performance benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of cMonkey2 in accurate network reconstruction as well as the broad applicability across cell types. Performance aside, a major addition to the software is that is has been converted from being solely a biclustering algorithm to a biclustering and data integration platform. The new platform enables easy integration of many different additional data types, allowing users to expand the data classes to include categories we have not thought of yet.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the signature features of cMonkey is its ability to integrate additional relevant sources of information. For example, many metabolic pathways have been experimentally defined in bakers yeast and various bacteria. Such pathway information can be assimilated as an association network that guides the algorithm in finding parsimonious biclusters. Various association networks based on interactions among proteins, DNA, and other molecules can also be used to aid this process. In the end, the clusters that arise are the ones that can best account for all the disparate types of data that are fed into the algorithm. This integrative approach gave cMonkey an advantage compared to other biclustering algorithms when it was released, and continues to be a distinguishing characteristic in its’ updated form.</p>

<p>There is a major opportunity to build bicluster networks from plentiful publicly available consortium datasets generated by multiple independent laboratories. This opportunity also presents a challenge because variation between the sources can introduce noise that reduces bicluster quality. In a paper published on April 15 in the journal <em>BMC Systems Biology</em>, ISB researchers have added a new metric to the cMonkey scoring algorithm to improve the quality of biclusters when dealing with highly variable source datasets. This metric improved the accuracy of condition-specific gene clustering, including a demonstrable enhancement in predicting a physiological response to nutrient shifts in yeast cells.</p>
<p>Beyond including the new bicluster quality metric, the revised cMonkey2 is now modularized to facilitate facile incorporation of additional data types, as well as adjustment of the weights those data types receive in the biclustering calculations. The resulting outputs of biclusters are easily interrogated using an intuitive web-based framework, and the data can be further analyzed and visualized using additional software that has been developed by the Baliga laboratory, different groups at the ISB, and the rest of the scientific community. A final note worth mentioning is the programming language: Originally built in the statistical modeling environment R, the updated version has been rewritten in Python, one of the most widely used programming languages today.</p>
<p>The benchmark results in the paper speak for themselves, but suffice it to say this is a uniquely comprehensive and powerful tool for modern systems biology research. To encourage widespread adoption of cMonkey2, the documentation for usage and development has been updated and expanded. Using this approach, genetic and molecular data generated from any organism, be it a bacterium or a birch tree, can be explored and analyzed from a network perspective.</p>
