		<p><img class="wp-image-49599 alignright" src="http://pbd.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Josh-rice-plant-300x199.jpg" alt="Josh-rice-plant" width="504" height="334" />The interdisciplinary fields of systems biology &amp; synthetic biology are closely related and focus on the interactions of biological systems. However, while systems biologists take a comprehensive approach to the study of molecules, cells, organisms, or species and their environment, synthetic biologists build on this information to design and construct novel biological systems or to modify existing functions.</p>
<p>Systems biology seeks to describe and understand the dynamic and complex nature of living systems. The behavior of these systems may be hard to predict from the study of individual components, so interacting groups of a system are measured quantitatively using genetic technologies, biochemical and chemical tools, and computational modeling. The system is characterized by combining quantitative measurements with knowledge gained from large-scale studies such as genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. Systems biology is currently applied to m any areas, including biological, biomedical, and environmental research and will be integral to future human health discoveries and breakthroughs in environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>PBD researchers develop novel methods to analyze genome-, transcriptome- and proteome-scale datasets in order to predict biological networks, annotate gene functions, and reconstruct transcriptional regulation. These biological networks (e.g., protein interaction, metabolic and regulatory pathways) are studied to determine how they can be accurately defined based on experimental data, as well as how they relate to one another and evolve. Scientists are developing, evaluating, and improving computational annotation of proteomes to aid in the prediction of protein domains from sequence and homology prediction. In a more theoretical capacity, computational techniques are being employed to perform a comparative analysis of regulatory systems in order to assign function to hypothetical genes and identify missing genes in metabolic pathways.</p>
<p>Scientists and engineers in the field of synthetic biology seek to design and build novel biological systems using the principles and techniques of biotechnology, engineering, evolutionary biology, chemistry, molecular biology, systems biology, computer science, and biophysics. Synthetic biology expands the focus of genetic engineering to whole systems of genes and gene products, rather than individual genes. Researchers could add or modify biological functions to existing organisms or, in the future, design and construct novel biological pathways or organisms with tailored properties.</p>
<p>Efforts have been focused on how to predictably engineer gene expression in a microbe and how quantitative characterization, modeling, and biomolecular design can vastly increase the reliability of engineered circuits in bacteria. Researchers have created a suite of synthetic biology tools for rational engineering of gene expression in microbes, developed predictive DNA sequence-activity relationships that yield insight into important biological mechanisms, devised methods to score genetic parts by quantifying the context effects on parts performance, and uncovered design principles in microbial stress responses. These contributions are at the core of what distinguishes the emerging field of synthetic biology from the founder fields of genetic and metabolic engineering—a focus on making genetic parts and circuit design rational, predictable, and reliable. All of these are necessary steps towards realizing the real potential for biological solutions to current problems in medicine, energy, and environment.</p>
<p><img class="  wp-image-49600 alignleft" src="http://pbd.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/PaR-PaR-robot11-294x300.jpg" alt="PaR-PaR-robot11" width="425" height="433" />Sustainable energy is a significant challenge facing our planet and securing carbon-neutral sources of energy is essential to meeting growing energy demands while addressing environmental concerns. Energy and fuels produced from plant biomass offer an important renewable solution to this problem and also allow reduction in the overall release of greenhouse gases. PBD researchers are constructing new biosynthetic pathways in bacterial hosts that can convert plant biomass into fuel molecules. Using synthetic biology methods, they can draw enzymes from a variety of different environmental organisms and combine them in a single genetically engineered host. This mix-and-match approach allows for the creation and customization of new biological tools for multi-step, multi-enzyme chemical synthesis. Division bioengineers are creating new biosynthetic pathways in microbial hosts for <em>in vivo</em> production of both biofuels from abundant crop feedstocks and pharmaceuticals from natural products or natural product scaffolds. A unifying theme in this research is the emphasis on obtaining a detailed molecular understanding of how living cells control enzymatic processes within the context of the entire metabolic network.</p>
<p>Computational methods for encapsulating the function of biomolecules based on precise chemical models are also employed. Data are aggregated from various sources to form the ontological basis, and then synthesis and verification tools are developed that employ this information to automatically design engineered organisms with new functions. This has been successfully demonstrated by designing the synthesis of a bacterium that produces acetaminophen.</p>
<p>Synthetic biologists work to optimize of specific pathways already occurring in bacteria that produce different chemicals that can be used as drugs, biofuels, or commodity chemicals. This involves diagnosing imbalances using a &#8220;multiomic&#8221; approach, balancing the expression of the different pathway enzymes through dynamic regulation, and integrating the pathway genes into the host cell genetic material.</p>
<p>Another application of synthetic biology would establish an interface between the living world and the non-living technological world through cellular-electrical connections. This new class of smart, self-renewing nanostructured systems has the potential to revolutionize environmental sensing and energy harvesting applications, as well as open new avenues to program cellular behavior. To this end, researchers explore how naturally occurring microbes achieve electron transfer to inorganic surfaces and will use genetic and materials surface engineering to create new &#8216;domesticated&#8217; hybrid cell-electrode systems.</p>

<p><strong>Tools &amp; Technology</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase<a href="http://pbd.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cell-wall.png"><img class="  wp-image-49604 alignright" src="http://pbd.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cell-wall-300x300.png" alt="cell-wall" width="313" height="313" /></a></strong></p>
<p>The DOE Systems Biology Knowledgebase (KBase; http://kbase.us) is an open software and data platform that aims to enable researchers to predict and ultimately design biological function. This web resource has been designed to meet the grand challenge of systems biology: predicting and ultimately designing biological function. KBase enables secure sharing of data, tools, and conclusions in a unified, extensible system that allows researchers to collaboratively generate, test, and share hypotheses about molecular and cellular functions. Users can perform large-scale analyses on KBase’s scalable computing infrastructure and combine multiple lines of evidence to model with increasing accuracy plant and microbial physiology and community dynamics. KBase seeks to manifest a system that will enable efficient cycles of model-driven experimental design and refinement to support discoveries of biomolecular function; insights into cellular network operation and organismal adaptation within heterogeneous populations in changeable environments; and organism modifications for effective biodesign of cellular, tissue, and ecosystem behavior for energy and environmental applications.</p>
<p><strong>Clotho</strong></p>
<p>Clotho environment (<a href="http://www.clothocad.org/">http://www.clothocad.org/</a>), developed in collaboration with the Densmore Lab at Boston University, is a computationally driven platform for the design of genetic organisms that minimizes the uncertainties and errors of such projects. Through combining software, automation, engineered cells, and new molecular biology techniques, key bottlenecks observed within synthetic biology’s most popular driving applications are addressed and solved. The platform is built around a computational method for encapsulating the function of biomolecules based on precise chemical models. This approach aggregates data from various sources and then develops synthesis and verification tools that employ this information to automatically design engineered organisms with new functions.</p>
<p><strong>MicrobesOnline.org</strong></p>
<p>Genome sequencing has contributed greatly to understanding the incredible diversity of bacteria. Computational tools are used to analyze these genomic data to help uncover how diverse bacteria work. One of the most powerful bioinformatics resources developed is MicrobesOnline.org, which contains programs for determining phylogenetic trees, the GLAMM interactive viewer for metabolic pathways and experiments, as well as tools for analyzing large protein sequence databases and predicting operons. This information can lead to breakthroughs in biotechnology, managing the environment, and manipulating the human microbiome.</p>
<p><strong>Bioinformatics tools and databases</strong></p>
<p>Many methods that enable the sharing and collection of data have been developed as part of the ENIGMA (Ecosystems and Networks Integrated with Genes and Molecular Assemblies) project. Because systems biologists depend upon many software tools that operate on many kinds of data from multiple sources, researchers constructed Gaggle, a framework for exchanging data between independently developed software tools and databases to enable interactive exploration of systems biology data.</p>

RegTransBase is a manually curated database of regulatory interactions in prokaryotes captured in published scientific literature using a controlled vocabulary. Another database, RegPrecise, holds an extensive collection of transcription factor regulatory annotations obtained by comparative genomic analysis in a variety of prokaryotic genomes. RegPredict is a program that offers fast and accurate reconstruction of transcriptional regulons by comparative genomics. Computational tools that are developed by the ENIGMA team are being integrated into KBase.</p>
<p>Scientists are endeavoring to assign the function of previously uncharacterized genes that have been identified by genomic sequencing. Therefore, methodologies that rapidly and systematically determine gene function across a range of diverse microorganisms are crucial, such as the universal TagModule collection for the parallel analysis of defined mutant collections in any number of microbial species. TagModule is being used to assign phenotypes for the majority of genes in metal-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria. A computational web resource, SIFTER (Statistical Inference of Function Through Evolutionary Relationships), utilizes a statistical approach to predicting protein function that uses a protein family&#8217;s phylogenetic tree as the natural structure for representing protein relationships.</p>

<h4>Current Research Examples</h4>
<h5> Using Bacteria to Perform Chemical Reactions</h5>
<p>Many therapeutics used to treat human health conditions come from natural products and their scaffolds. Several successful drugs contain a certain chemical bond (C-F) that can be used to optimize drug activity and specificity, as well as in vivo metabolism. However, the selective formation of these bonds is difficult since chemical methods require harsh reagents that do not allow for controlling the resulting product form. New biocatalysts are being developed to produce selective and efficient C-F bond formation under mild conditions through the isolation, characterization, and mechanistic investigation of new enzymes that perform this reaction naturally. These designer enzymes will have broad impact as synthetic tools for drug discovery and development.</p>
<h5>PR-PR</h5>
<p>PBD scientitsts and engineers develop and demonstrate experimental wetware, software, and laboratory automation devices that facilitate, accelerate, and standardize the engineering of microbes that produce fuels from cellulosic biomass. To that end, researchers utilize processes including biological component characterization and re-usability/interchangeability and computer-aided design. Their efforts have yielded an open-source biology friendly programming language, PR-PR, which has utility as a cross-platform lab automation system. PR-PR can be used with liquid-handling robots, microfluidics, and microscopy, as well as for protocol translation into human languages. In the course of further developing PR-PR, researchers wrote protocols for common methods employed to manipulate DNA: combinatorial modified Golden Gate DNA assembly, Kunkel DNA mutagenesis and hierarchical Gibson DNA assembly. This system enables experimental protocols to be shared and reproduced between laboratories, even if different equipment is in use, which will accelerate collaboration and scientific discovery</p>
