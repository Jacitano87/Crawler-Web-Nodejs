		<p><a href="http://pbd.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Division_FuelsSynthesis_Image-532x350.jpg"><img class="wp-image-49544 alignleft" src="http://pbd.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Division_FuelsSynthesis_Image-532x350-300x197.jpg" alt="Division_FuelsSynthesis_Image-532x350" width="466" height="306" /></a>Imagine all of the cars, trucks and jet planes in this nation being powered by fuels that are produced from a renewable source. Imagine that the burning of these fuels does not contribute to global climate change. Imagine that these fuels are produced in the USA, generating jobs and revenue and helping to free our country from dependence on foreign oil. That is the promise of bioenergy.</p>
<p>Plants can be thought of as warehouses for solar energy. Through photosynthesis, plants collect sunlight and convert it into chemical energy in the form of sugars called cellulose that are stored in their biomass. Given that enough sunlight bathes the earth in a single hour to meet human energy needs for an entire year, the cellulosic biomass of non-food plants and agricultural waste represents an enormous source of energy.</p>
<p>The most widely used biofuel today is ethanol, a two-carbon alcohol whose carbon-oxygen bonds yield only about 70-percent of the energy per volume of gasoline’s hydrocarbon bonds. Advanced biofuels are oil-like hydrocarbons, such as the four-carbon alcohol butanol, that yield almost the same amount of energy per volume as gasoline. Unlike ethanol, advanced biofuels can replace gasoline, diesel and jet fuels on a gallon-for-gallon basis in today’s combustion engines with no loss of performance. Also unlike ethanol, which absorbs water that corrodes pipelines, advanced biofuels can be used in today’s supply and delivery infrastructures.</p>
<p>The idea behind advanced biofuels is to develop “fuel crops” that can thrive on lands not suitable for food crops with little fertilization or irrigation, extract sugars from the biomass of these fuel crops, and then ferment the sugars into liquid transportation fuels through a process similar to that used to make beer or wine.</p>
<p>Commercialization of advanced biofuels requires cost-effective means of extracting cellulose from plant biomass.  The cellulose in plant cell walls is not easily extracted. Cellulose consists of strong cable-like microfibrils harboring thousands of molecules of glucose, a monosaccharide, and hemicellulose, a polysaccharide made from a variety of five- and six-carbon sugars. As further protection, cellulose is wrapped inside lignin, a rigid non-carbohydrate polymer that forms a protective coating around cellulose and hemicellulose, shielding these sugars from attack by enzymes and microbes. Lignin is also a source of chemical by-products that can inhibit the conversion of sugars into biofuels. Research into deconstruction approaches comprises an important part of the PBD programs.</p>
<p>Commercialization of advanced biofuels also requires cost-effective and energy-effcient means of fermenting fuels from complex sugars. While glucose can be readily fermented into biofuels, hemicellulose poses major difficulties. The common yeast, which is used to ferment simple starch-based sugars into ethanol, cannot digest the polysaccharide sugars in cellulosic biomass. New microbes will have to be either found or engineered with enzymes that do the job.  Fuels synthesis is another important PBD activity.</p>
<p>Finally, plants that will serve as the best feedstocks for the production of biofuels need to be identified and wherever possible improved upon to obtain the highest possible yield of biofuel per unit of land per year. For example, perennial grasses such as Miscanthus and switchgrass feature a special type of photosynthesis that makes them highly efficient in their use of water. Yields in excess of 25 tons of useable biomass per acre annually without irrigation have been reported. Other plants that have high potential as future fuel crops include trees such as poplar, hybrid poplar and willow, alfalfa, sorghum and algae.  PBD researchers work to optimize feedstocks to provide the best possible overall biomass for biofuel and bioproducts production.</p>
<p>There is an ample amount of land available that could be used to grow fuel crops with no impact on the food crops for humans or animals. In the United States alone, these lands total about 300 million acres, an area nearly three times the size of California. Given that transportation fuels are the largest end-use of energy by sector in the United States, meeting the bulk of our nation’s transportation energy needs with clean, green and renewable advanced biofuels makes good economic, environmental and national security sense.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><em>Technology and Tools</em></strong></span></p>
<p>PBD scientists and engineers investigate and develop new technologies to advance the research and development of bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts. Many techniques, described below, are being used by researchers to help reach scientific goals such as characterizing genes and proteins in both natural and engineered plants and microorganisms, engineering new fuel-generating organisms and improved fuel plants, and visualizing plant cell walls and their components.</p>
<p><strong>Array-based Assays </strong>- Current synthetic biology methods require the creation of many pathway variations to find the optimal biofuel expression profile. High-throughput technologies being developed by PBD researchers make it possible to assay thousands of different strain variants, or thousands of different enzyme mutants. Central to this approach is the integration of micro-scale liquid handling with nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry. This versatile platform is suitable for characterization of enzymatic activities and targeted metabolite analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Microfluidic Assays</strong> &#8211; Enzymes are the workhorse catalysts involved in many aspects of bioenergy and biofuels research. PBD researchers are developing high-throughput and high-content assay platforms for characterizing enzymes and enzyme-variants, along with their substrates and products. To this end, state-of-the-art microfluidic chips can be interfaced with fluorescence detectors for rapid and sensitive detection. The goal is to develop crosscutting micro-scale technologies for advancing biofuels development that are robust and easy to use.</p>

Additional advanced 3D imaging approaches, such as electron tomography and focused ion beam SEM and serial block face SEM, are employed by PBD researchers for analytical studies. Apart from cellular ultrastructure, scientists and engineers use affinity- and tag-based labeling approaches to identify and map out candidate proteins and carbohydrates.</p>
<p><strong>Proteomics</strong> &#8211; PBD researchers develop and utilize state-of-the-art mass spectrometry methods to provide protein characterization and quantification. Their work includes identification of novel biomass-degrading enzymes from compost samples for deconstruction, characterization of the cytosolic and organelle proteomes for feedstocks optimization, and quantification of key proteins in engineered microbes for fuels synthesis. PBD proteomics research focuses on developing methods that speed iterations of the metabolic engineering cycle (design, build, test, learn) and helps characterize biomass and biomass deconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>Structural Biology</strong> – Structural Biologists use high resolution X-ray crystallography to understand the atomic structure of proteins involved in biofuels production. Employing powerful X-ray beams available at Berkeley Lab’s Advanced Light Source, they can reveal the chemical reactions used by enzymes to convert sugars into biofuels. The same methods are also used to help understand how proteins can be active in harsh pretreatment environments, and how the plant cell wall is synthesized.</p>
<p><strong>Synthetic Biology Informatics</strong> &#8211; Using Synthetic Biology Informatics, researchers develop and demonstrate experimental wetware, software, and laboratory automation devices that facilitate, accelerate, and standardize the engineering of microbes that produce fuels from cellulosic biomass. Processes utilized include biological component characterization and re-usability/interchangeability, and computer-aided design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Current Research Examples</h4>
<h5>Drop-in biofuels</h5>
<p>Drop-in biofuels can directly replace existing hydrocarbon based fuels.  PBD researchers focus on identifying potential drop-in biofuels, then building and optimizing the metabolic pathway to produce these target fuels in microbes. Major target fuels are isoprenoid-based compounds that can be alternatives to gasoline, jet, and diesel fuels. To improve fuel production titer and yield, the producing host and fuel biosynthetic pathway are studied intensively using various advanced analytical tools such as targeted proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics. This information allows PBD researchers to engineer the metabolic pathway in the producing host using synthetic biology tools.</p>

<h5>Cell wall engineering for feedstock plants</h5>
<p>PBD researchers are using genetic engineering to develop healthy plants whose lignocellulosic biomass can be reduced more easily into simple sugars for the production of advanced biofuels. Working with the model plant, Arabidopsis, and using the tools of synthetic biology, researchers are discovering novel ways to reduce the production of lignin while increasing the yield of fuel sugars in plant cell walls.  Current research activities focus on plant engineering, which is applicable to many plant species, to achieve several aims: optimization of plant development and biomass for sustainable energy-crop and bioenergy production, reduction of cell-wall recalcitrance and, ultimately, optimized energy-crop production. Researchers are building non-existing biosynthetic pathways in specific plant-tissues such as lignifying cells. Their goal is to produce novel lignin monomers, which will modify the physical properties of the lignin and in turn reduce its recalcitrance and/or valorize this aromatic polymer for down-stream applications. Scientists and engineers are redesigning cell wall biosynthetic pathways and regulatory networks to improve cell wall properties for bioenergy applications and developing yeast tools to screen for plant proteins mediating cellular export of aromatic metabolites derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway.</p>
<p>Projects related to these efforts include:<img class="  wp-image-49551 alignright" src="http://pbd.lbl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Swtichgrass-600x350-300x175.jpg" alt="Swtichgrass-600x350" width="528" height="308" /></p>
